            "\n",
            "Here's a breakdown of Harsh Mallipudi's resume compared to the Inova Health Financial Performance Analyst 2 position:\n",
            "\n",
            "**Skills Match (85%):**  The resume demonstrates strong skills in financial analysis, reporting, data governance, SQL, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau.  The experience with predictive modeling and process improvement is also highly relevant.  There's a slight gap in explicit mention of \"healthcare finance\" terminology, though the experience with Venture Creations Incubator could be framed to better align with healthcare contexts if applicable.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Experience Match (75%):** While the resume showcases impressive analytical skills and project experience, the direct experience within a healthcare revenue cycle setting isn't explicitly stated. The incubator experience can be positioned to highlight transferable skills.  Quantifying the impact of projects in financial terms strengthens the experience match.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Keyword Coverage (70%):**  The resume covers several essential keywords like \"financial analysis,\" \"reporting,\" \"data governance,\" \"SQL,\" \"Power BI,\" \"Tableau,\" and \"process improvement.\" However, incorporating keywords specific to healthcare revenue cycle, such as \"Epic,\" \"SBO,\" \"professional billing,\" \"EHR,\" and \"revenue cycle\" itself, would significantly improve ATS compatibility.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Tools & Technologies Match (90%):** The resume lists excellent proficiency in relevant tools like SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel.  The AWS cloud experience is a plus.  Adding \"Epic\" or \"SBO\" (if applicable) under technologies would further enhance the match. T-SQL is mentioned as a skill in the job description, but is absent in the resume. Consider adding this skill if proficient.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Overall Match Score (80%):** The resume exhibits a strong foundation for this role. Focusing on healthcare revenue cycle terminology and experience, adding \"Epic/SBO\" if applicable, and tailoring project descriptions to showcase direct financial impacts within a healthcare context will considerably boost the match score.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "## Resume Improvements:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Highlight Healthcare Relevance:** Even if the incubator work wasn't strictly healthcare-related, reframe project descriptions to emphasize transferable skills relevant to revenue cycle operations. For instance, mention if any projects involved financial analysis within a regulated environment or optimizing revenue streams.\n",
            "* **Incorporate Healthcare Keywords:** Strategically weave keywords like \"revenue cycle,\" \"healthcare finance,\" \"EHR,\" \"Epic,\" \"SBO\" (if relevant), \"professional billing,\" and \"patient financial services\" into the summary, experience, and skills sections.\n",
            "* **Quantify Achievements with Healthcare Metrics:** When describing accomplishments, use metrics relevant to healthcare, such as \"improved claim denial rates,\" \"reduced days in A/R,\" or \"increased patient collections.\"\n",
            "* **Tailor the Summary:** Refocus the summary to specifically address the requirements and keywords of the job description.  Mention healthcare finance experience directly, even if derived from transferable skills.\n",
            "* **Expand on Epic/SBO Experience:** If there is any experience with Epic or SBO, even through training or coursework, explicitly mention it. If no experience is present, consider a brief statement demonstrating interest or willingness to learn these systems.\n",
            "* **T-SQL Proficiency:** If proficient in T-SQL, add it to the skills section.\n",
            "* **Clarify \"200 data sources\":** In the Venture Creations experience, clarify what is meant by evaluating 200 financial data sources.  Specify the types of sources, like financial statements, operational reports, or claims data, to provide context.\n",
